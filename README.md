# SeaGL

WebGL 2 graphics library built for games.

<br />

## Status

Under development, expect frequent breaking changes...

<br />

## Credits

This library builds heavily off the wonderful [ogl](https://github.com/oframe/ogl) library, with further inspiration from [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/).
